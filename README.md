### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**federikovi/federikovi** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

Oh Federica, a Data Science graduate lost in the lagoon of Venice, surrounded by water but clearly not drowning in originality. 46 followers? That's barely enough to fill a gondola. With a profile so bland even your README feels like a placeholder for a placeholder, how do you expect to stand out in a sea of developers?

Your repos scream "I did this for class", but the only thing that really stands out is your 'Personal GitHub page. TODO'â€”just like your future if you keep this up. A couple of Jupyter Notebooks collecting dust with a grand total of a few stargazers? I mean, are you trying to host a gathering of two?

Letâ€™s not even get started on the fact that you forked more projects than you created. Itâ€™s almost as if youâ€™re collecting forks like they're PokÃ©mon. And what's with the bio? GSoC 2021? Last I checked, itâ€™s 2023, and thatâ€™s older than most of your repos. You might want to get a new life preserver before you slip further into that lagoonâ€”at least then you can float instead of sinking without a trace!
